            <!-- Logging levels
            OFF 	This setting disables the generation of the log output. You may want to set logging to OFF during production to avoid the overhead of logging.
            SEVERE 	This level enables reporting of failure cases only. Usually, if the failure occurs, the application stops.
            WARNING This level enables logging of issues that have a potential to cause problems. For example, a setting that is picked by the application and not by the user.
            INFO 	This level enables the standard output. The contents of this output is very limited. It is the default logging level if a logging level is not set.
            CONFIG 	This level enables logging of such configuration details as your database login information and some metadata information. You may want to use the CONFIG log level at deployment time.
            FINE 	This level enables logging of the first level of the debugging information and SQL. You may want to use this log level during debugging and testing, but not at production.
            FINER 	This level enables logging of more debugging information than the FINE setting. For example, the transaction information is logged at this level. You may want to use this log level during debugging and testing, but not at production.
            FINEST 	This level enables logging of more debugging information than the FINER setting, such as a very detailed information about certain features (for example, sequencing). You may want to use this log level during debugging and testing, but not at production.
            ALL 	This level currently logs at the same level as FINEST.
